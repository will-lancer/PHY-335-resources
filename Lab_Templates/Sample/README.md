This is a lab report James and I wrote. I wrote the introduction on
this one, as I don't have access to James' one with an intro. This is
just to give you a reference to what a completed report looks like.

The pdf of the lab report was too big to upload here (ðŸ’€), so
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FA3tBWWR1F5wZxAAN3My_9Oun6dS68er/view?usp=sharing) 
is a Google Drive link hosting it (you will need to login to an
SBU account to view this).
