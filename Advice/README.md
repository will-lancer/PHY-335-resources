This is some advice for PHY 335. If you follow this, it will
probably shave ~10 hours per week off of your workload for each
person, and will probably make your life a lot easier when you
take the class.


 * **Ask your professor (I had Corliss) if you can just take data
   straight into a Google Sheet**. This is just to save you the trouble
   of having to enter and re-enter data unnecessarily, and will save
   you at least 2 - 4 per week in tedium.
 * **Use AI to do data analysis for you**. PHY 335 allows you to use
   AI, so this is not cheating, and it's actually one of the main
   purposes of AI. This will save *at least* four hours per week.
 * **When you make tables, use AI to make them for you, or use the
   table making website listed in the template folder**. This will
   save another 2 - 4 hours per week, at least, as you would've had
   to enter 100s of data points to three sig figs, with uncertainties,
   for multiple different experiments. Yikes.
 * **Don't use your grace days in the beginning**. The lab reports in the
   middle of the year are the hardest, and your other classes will most
   likely also be at their peaks during that time; work a bit harder
   in the beginning, and save your grace days for when you actually need
   them.
 * **Try hard on the lab reports**. This shouldn't even have to be said,
   but actually try on your lab reports. Most people don't. This is a
   bad idea for a few reasons, one of them more subtle than the others.
   The first is that bad work doesn't get As, so you wouldn't get one of
   those. The second is that writing and preparing the lab reports is
   going to probably be your main form of studying for the class, besides
   the game plans. The third is not commented upon, but I think it's one
   of the main things that makes or breaks teams during the semester.
   The class gets harder as the semester goes on, peaks around Units 5 - 6,
   then tapers back down. Here's the thing, though: doing the lab reports can
   actually get easier as the semester goes on. This isn't a contradiction,
   and it's because *you* get better at *doing* the lab reports as the
   year goes on, *if* you actually *try* on them. It's like going to the
   gym to lift weights; yeah, sure, the weights get heavier, but you also
   get stronger. The thing is, a lot of people coast in the beginning of
   335, and then get absolutely shafted by the middle of the semester lab reports.
   This doesn't have to happen. If you consistently
   put effort into the class, you will get better at writing the lab reports, and your
   ability to do them will match the difficulty of the units as the semester goes on.
 * **Start on the lab reports early, and work on them consistently**. The lab reports
   are going to take a while, regardless of how clever you are with your usage
   of ChatGPT. Start them early, and work on them consistently, or else you're just
   going to suffer unnecessarily. You already know this is true, but it's especially
   true for this class, so I figured I'd remind you.
 * **Pick a good lab partner**. Again, obvious tip here, but if your lab partner sucks,
   so will your life when you take this class. Your lab partner is going to go 50/50
   with you on work *the entire semester*, so you better find someone to do that with
   effectively. Take this *very* seriously; have someone that you know will be reliable
   before registering for the class. You shouldn't be the person who finds their lab parter
   on their first day; this is kind of like trying to find your future wife/husband at a nightclub.
   Yeah, it's possible, but the chance of success is prettty low.
 * **Embrace the fact that this is going to be a difficult class**. This class is
   just going to be hard. That's ok. Expect it, and don't be surprised when it's actually
   difficult.

Good luck.
